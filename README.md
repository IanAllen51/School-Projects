# School-Projects

This Repo is a representaton of Coding projects and assignments that i completed during my
time at Washington State University. The coding is a collection of C#, C++, Python, SQL, and
some assembly. (Java projects will be added at a later time). 

The Data Structures and Algorithms section includes applications of Stacks, Queues, Binary
and Binary Search Trees, suffix trees, and graph data structures. Algorithms highlighted in
this section include dijkstra graphs, mergesort, and Needleman Wunsch dynamic sequence alignment.

The C# projects section focus on OOP coding. Projects include an Excel Project, an RSS Maping Program,
a Plants vs Zombies game, a TOHO Bullet Hell game, and a shape sequence builder program. The Excel 
project emulates the functionality of Microsoft Excel, including data cell manipulation, arithmatic of
cells, redo/undo functionality, and ciclical referencing. The RSS Maping program includes a database of
newspaper articles and utilizes GPS maping to search and find locations of given articles. The Plants 
vs. Zombies game focusses on the use of inherited decorator classes as well as factory classes to produce 
waves of different zombies. The TOHO Bullet Hell project that makes extensive use of decorator and 
factory classes in a classic arcade game, including waves of different opponents and bosses that fire
different shape and pattern projectiles. The shape sequenceBuilder project focusses on polymorphism of
a base shape class, in which the user will create a sequence of different sized shapes and can 
alter the sequence or size of shapes, calculate total area, and display the built sequences.

The Python Project section includes a 3D graphing Tool that allows you to build a three dimensional 
representation of a graph including color coding vertices, edge numbering and movable nodes that can be
moved to another location on the grid while maintaining proper edges to adjacent nodes; The program also
includes a randomize ability that will scramble the connected graph to give alternate perspectives you
might not consider in a standard 2D representation. The PostScript Project is a series of functions that
emulates the Adobe PostScript language, allowing for the formation and execution of PostScript coding. The
encrypton/decryption project was created for a cybersecurity class, the project allows for the scrambling 
of a jpeg image with a generated key, and reassembly with said key.

The Yelp Database project section includes Python and SQL code that was used to parse various Yelp Data 
JSON files into a postgres SQL database. C# code was used to generate a WinForm that would access the
postgres database and fill the form with yelp data including buisiness names, ratings, location, etc. 
Through the winform a user can refine searches and select information to be displayed. Such searches are
done by gerating unique SQL queries with the user selected data and accessing the postgres database.

More projects will be added.
